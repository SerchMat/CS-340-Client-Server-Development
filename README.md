# How do you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable? Especially consider your work on the CRUD Python module from Project One, which you used to connect the dashboard widgets to the database in Project Two. What were the advantages of working in this way? How else could you use this CRUD Python module in the future?

The best progress to write a program that is maintainable, readable, and adaptable is to divide the program into small tasks and manage every task to work efficiently. I develop and run every part individually to make sure that they run properly. 

# How do you approach a problem as a computer scientist? Consider how you approached the database or dashboard requirements that Grazioso Salvare requested. How did your approach to this project differ from previous assignments in other courses? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to create databases to meet other client requests?

As a computer scientist, I first understand and analyze what is the purpose, the functionality, and the process that I will have to achieve to solve their problem. I like to divide the project until small tasks and test them individually to see what to verify that everything is running correctly. After finishing developing every part of the project I test all the projects to verify it can run altogether. The approach of every project that I develop is been constant which provided me with success in my projects. 

# What do computer scientists do, and why does it matter? How would your work on this type of project help a company, like Grazioso Salvare, to do their work better?

Computer Scientists conduct research into fundamental computer and information science. I like to research and create efficient ways to conduct the best research for my clients.
